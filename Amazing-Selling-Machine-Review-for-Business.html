I want to go over everything I know about the program and the course, and i can help you make an informed decision and give you everything I know about the course. And with that being said, guys, let's begin.<br><br>Now, as if you talk about today's topic, a lot of people are skeptical about the amazing selling machine review. I think the courses are really, really high quality and there's no doubt. A lot of people have made some serious money off the program, but I noticed also like a lot of like bias with use, really saying how amazing the courses it's just so they can actually affiliate commission.So I wanted to make a different type of the video for you going over four reasons why you would not want to actually buy the course, because quite frankly, as amazing as the course is it's not for everyone.The amazing selling machine course is actually not a scam.<br><br>There's a lot of skeptical people out there. Aren't skeptical myself because it's just a lot of crap out there in the marketplace. It's a lot of scams. There's a lot. Yeah. Get rich, quick opportunities. So if you are skeptical, I genuinely. Understand, because I feel the same way, which is why I wanted to make this quick video for you, because I wanted to go, I got all the knowledge I have regarding the program.<br><br>So is that amazing selling machine scam? First of all, let's just, you know, address the big elephant in the room, right? No, it isn't. Okay. In fact, what I'm gonna do for you guys to leave a link down below to their success stories page on which goes over a Han shall testimonials from people, succeeding with the program from all different walks of life and all living down below to their free training.And to the order form page as well. If you want to like learn more about the person I'm in general and based with that information, you can really make an informed decision state if they're amazing selling machine program, at least up to his expectations. And yeah. See if it's actually going to help you with your business.<br><br>But with that being said, guys, let's go today's video and go over the four reasons you might not want to actually purchase the program.Now the first reason why you would not want to buy the amazing selling machine is if you are looking to make quick money fast without any effort, or basically doing any work. Okay. Because a lot of people message me and ask me, is it actually possible for me to make this work? Me, you know, like it's actually possible for me to proceed with amazing selling machine based on my personal situation.And to be frankly honest, it really depends on the individual. Like, I can never really promise you or Noah can really promise you that you'll succeed or make money or anything really. And the reason why I'm saying this and, you know, telling you like not to buy the program, if you're looking to make a millions.<br><br>Yeah. Well, it's pretty simple because you can't make millions out of a night. Do you know of any program that's literally unrealistic and you need to have like realistic expectations with this, if you're going to invest money. Okay. Maybe that type of person that invest money into, you know yeah. High ticket costs that can really obviously provide you a lot of value and just go for it and, you know, for a short period of time and be like, yeah, I haven't made any money yet, even though I haven't actually set up everything.<br><br>Right. Well, of course he's you just started the course, but I give us some time, but I know on the flip side, there's a lot of you seriously. Equal. You want to actually change your lock. You want to live a life full of freedom. You may even want to quit that nine to five job, which is understandable when I came in here, even having aspirations like that.So if you're like wondering whether or not this will work for you, it's honestly going to be based on the work output you're going to be putting in. So are you going to give the program some time, go for the content, take massive action and you don't have all the resources will be the program and actually seek help and, you know, utilize the mental shift.<br><br>And, you know, learn from millionaires by asking questions within the Facebook group, then. Yeah. I don't see how you can not succeed, but at the same time, it's going to be up to you. You know, making millions overnight or even making millions in a year, those results aren't typical, but will it work for you personally?I don't see how I won't, if you take massive action, but I can't promise you anything and that's going to be really up to you.Have a second reason why you will not actually want to buy the program is if you're not willing to invest in your own self education. Now, the program is a little bit pricey. I'm not going to lie. It's pretty obvious. The good news is guys, you can actually, instead of paying like $5,000 upfront, which is the price tag, I know it's a little bit expensive.<br><br>So, you know, this is a serious decision and you know, the normal reaction is that they like, I can't afford the program. Which you know, is a, any normal reaction, right? I can relate to that by all means. I'm not trying to dismiss it. Let's just pretend that you found out today, you need it for your life saving operation.Right. And the cost of that operation was $5,000. I mean, you want, wouldn't just say I can't afford it and just brush it off. Like this is your wife on the line, but at the same time, you just need to ask yourself, are you willing to do what it takes to make us the investment that could change your life?<br><br>And the good news is guys, you can actually pay in installments. So you're only paying like a $997. You know, every month or like six months instead of pain, like, you know, fuck upfront, which is good. That's really going to help. Like, you know, all of you guys get access to this program a lot more easier, but as the old saying goes, you get what you pay for.Well, and this is definitely the case for this program because this program is constantly being updated. So whenever there's like a new act Actemra service changes will be an Amazon. You know, there's going to be an update because the cost is constantly being updated to make sure it's actually relevant in today's world.<br><br>And yeah, that's reason. Number two.No reason number three is going to be, if you already have an established online business and making a lot of money online, then maybe you want to need to actually buy the amazing selling machine course, unless you want to make even more money and have like a second stream of income. So let's just say you're making like a ton of money online of bond income source.Let's just say that income source dies down completely. You'll be still making money off Amazon. Thanks to the amazing selling machine, you know, as a backup, but again, not everyone's making like a hundred thousand dollars a month for 50 grand a month. So again, you can make it like a hundred K a month off.<br><br>I'm not an income source already online, then it may be best for you just to focus on that and not actually buy the course because you don't want to have shiny object syndrome. Just like, you know, I'm trying to do 50 million things at once. If you don't have time to add an extra side income for yourself to make a bit of extra money, then just stay away and keep it doing what you're doing.And obviously if you're happy with your current results, like I said previously for the video, if you're keeping doing the same things over and over again, you kept getting the same results. Then keeping doing that. If you're getting the results you like, right. So reasonable McFlurry. In a nutshell, again, it's going to be really, based on your own personal circumstances, but in a nutshell, if you already are making a ton of money online and don't want a secondary income source on the side, or maybe even like a secondary full time income, that's also possible it does exist, then you don't need to buy any more courses because you already are making a ton of money.<br><br>And it's just best to focus on that. That's going to be mom raising about three for today's video.And the last reason for today's video reason, number four is going to be one of the most important reasons you have to keep in consideration on whether or not you want to buy the amazing selling machine course. And that's going to be time. Okay. Are you willing to invest a one hour day at least to go through the course and the actually applied information because.<br><br>Unfortunately, a lot of people buy courses and don't actually go for the course, which is insane. So, you know, because you have to really make an informed decision and really go for the course. And don't just let it collect thoughts because that's just literally wasting money. So if you can spend an hour a day, you know, going through this and putting a little bit of work, then probably stay away from this.Okay. I'm an hour. A day is not much, especially if you can yield such big returns for you again. The amazing selling machine is based around building a real business in the longterm. So yeah, that's my amazing selling machine review, video off genuinely hope from the bottom, my heart, he actually learned some new information and they are more familiar with the program and what I'm not going to be right for you.<br><br>I'll leave a couple of links down below where you can actually, first of all, see some like minded students and some like minded people, like just everyday folks like you and I. I'm succeeding with this program. So there's going to be a special link down below. We can see some success stories of just know hardworking people like you.And I succeeded this program. If you want to like, learn more about it and I'll leave a couple of links down below, we can directly buy it. And, you know, a link down below to their free training where you can learn more about the program in general and make an informed decision based off that as well.<br><br>That was a couple more important things I want to mention of the first thing is I am an affiliate, which means I do get a commission. If you did start the buy the course from my affiliate link. And though. Extra cost to you whatsoever. And the cool thing is guys, this is actually pretty cool because I can actually offer you and give you exclusive bonuses just on top of your purchase, which means you actually get access to it courses and upper like material that you would actually have to pay separately for our topic of your purchase, which includes Ranking on Google.<br><br>Ranking on YouTube, I'm getting traffic and stuff in general.
